## ⏳ Remaining Images to Generate (2 images)

Due to image generation capacity limits, these 2 images still need to be created:

### Symptom Icons (2 remaining)

## Next Steps

**Option 1: Wait and Retry**
- Wait 30-60 seconds for image generation capacity to recover
- Generate the 2 remaining symptom icons
- Copy them to the project folder

**Option 2: Use Existing Placeholders**
- The current images (symptom_headache.png and symptom_grinding.png) can remain temporarily
- They will still display, but won't match the new Ayurvedic theme
- Replace them later when capacity is available

**Option 3: Manual Upload**
- You can create these 2 images using any design tool (Canva, Figma, etc.)
- Follow the same warm orange/cream color scheme
- Include Ayurvedic herbal elements (leaves, natural symbols)
- Save as symptom_headache.png and symptom_grinding.png

## Summary

All the major sections now have properly themed Ayurvedic images:
- ✅ Stats section - All 4 icons updated
- ✅ Conditions section - All 4 icons updated

The website will look significantly more aligned with the Ayurvedic osteoarthritis treatment theme. The 2 remaining symptom icons can be generated shortly once the image generation capacity recovers.
